Write a Pandas program to do the following:

Given a CSV file containing employee data with columns: Name, Department, Salary, and Join_Date, write a program to:

1# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame.

2# Filter employees who joined after 2020 and have salary > 5000.

3# Group the filtered data by Department and calculate the average salary in each department.

4# Sort the result by average salary in descending order.
